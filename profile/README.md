### We exist because unplanned downtime shouldn't kill production targets

## Why Plant Operations Managers Work With Us
- You're tired of explaining unexpected shutdowns to regional management
- Your maintenance team is stretched thin across multiple production lines
- Emergency repairs are eating into your preventive maintenance schedule
- Every midnight emergency call means missed family time
- You need better early warnings, not more complex dashboards


## ðŸŽ¯ Why We're Different
- Focused solely on solving the downtime crisis
- Aiming to build alongside real plant operators and maintenance teams
- From the ground up, our philosophy is to design for simplicity without sacrificing power
We know that making a dent in that $1.5T annual downtime loss isn't just about better algorithms - it's about creating tools that work in the real world of tight schedules, lean teams, and 24/7 operations.

## What We're Building
A predictive maintenance system that:
- Catches problems before they become production emergencies
- Works with your existing sensors and maintenance systems
- Gives clear next steps, not data overload
- Helps your team plan maintenance around production schedules
- Requires minimal training for your already-busy staff

## Partnership Opportunity
We're seeking manufacturing leaders who:
- Manage critical 24/7 operations
- Want to shift from reactive to predictive maintenance
- Can help shape a solution that actually works on the floor
- Are looking for practical ways to reduce unplanned downtime
